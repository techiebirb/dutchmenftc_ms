before merging it the main branch, please come to me. DO NOT MERGE LIKE AN SOUL LESS MEAT BAG.

What does this code do? Good qustion
This code helps in improving the autonomous part of our bot

I added the manual code that we used for teleop at this location: https://github.com/techiebirb/dutchmenftc_ms/blob/main/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/OdoTest.java

To understand how the automation of out bot works 
Check out the [docs](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/tuning/).

I highly recommend reading the doc to understand whats going on. You only have to modify this part of the code in the repo : TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode
you dont have to modify anything. apart from this section.

Remember : We need to tune the bot before we add any actions to the bot for autonomous.

YOUR TEAM NEEDS YOU. DO YOUR PART

Regards,

CODING MASTER
